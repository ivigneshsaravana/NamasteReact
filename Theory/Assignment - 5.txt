1)  What is the difference between Named export, Default export and * as export?

=>  Named Export is used for exporting multiple values and importing them individually.
=>  Default Export is used for exporting a single value (variable, function, or class) that can be imported with any name.
=>  * as Export (Namespace Import) is used for importing all exports from a module as properties of a single object.

Ex:
Named Export/Import
	export const component;
	import {component} from "path";

Default Export/Import
	export default Component;
	import component from "path";


2)  What is the importance of config.js file?
	Config. js allows developers to configure their applications in an XML block instead of hard-coding values inside their scripts or in JSON objects.

	Security:Some sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, should not be hard-coded directly into your application code. Storing such information in a config.js file provides a level of separation and allows you to manage access to these configurations more securely.


3)  What are React Hooks?
	React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. 
	Hooks provide a way to reuse stateful logic across different components, making it easier to manage complex logic in functional components. 


4)  What is the useState Hook? 
	useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. 
    The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.
