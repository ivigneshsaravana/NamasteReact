what would happen if we do console.log(usestate())?

	If you were to do console.log(useState()), it would log the array returned by useState() to the console. This array would contain the current state value and the function to update that state.
		Here's an example of what console.log(useState()) might log:
			[initialStateValue, functionToUpdateState]

What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
	
	In the server-side routing, when we exchange data, we send requests and responses,
